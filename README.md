ðŸš€ Customer Retention & Churn Analysis

    Analyze e-commerce customer data to identify loyal vs. churned customers using RFM metrics and predict churn using a Random Forest Classifier. Gain actionable insights and visualize key patterns.

ðŸ“‚ Project Files

    main.py â€“ Python code for data cleaning, RFM calculation, churn analysis, and ML model

    OnlineRetail_sample.csv â€“ Sample dataset for analysis

    customer_churn_analysis.csv â€“ Processed dataset with RFM metrics and churn label

âš¡ How to Run

   Install libraries:

   pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn


   Place OnlineRetail_sample.csv in the same folder as main.py.

   Run the code:

   python main.py


   Outputs:

ðŸ›  Project Steps

Data Cleaning â€“ Remove missing CustomerIDs, negative quantities, calculate TotalPrice

RFM Metrics â€“ Recency, Frequency, Monetary

Churn Labeling â€“ Customers with Recency > 90 days â†’ Churn = 1

Exploratory Analysis â€“ Visualize distributions, calculate churn rate

Machine Learning â€“ Random Forest to predict churn

Feature Importance â€“ Identify which metric impacts churn most

Save Processed Data â€“ Ready for dashboards or further analysis

ðŸ“ˆ Insights

Customers with high Recency & low Frequency are most likely to churn

Monetary value is less predictive than Recency

Churn rate helps plan retention strategies and marketing campaigns
